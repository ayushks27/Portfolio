This is my personal portfolio website that I created to showcase my work as a developer. It highlights my skills, projects, and experience while serving as a central place for anyone to learn more about me. The portfolio includes an introduction about who I am, a detailed section on my technical skills, and a collection of projects with live demos and source code links. It is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a smooth experience across devices, and was built using modern web technologies such as React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. Through this portfolio, I aim to present my development journey in a professional way and provide an easy way for visitors to explore my work or connect with me.
